## Innovative Idea:

Our website relates to an existing website “PetCoach”. https://www.petcoach.co/educational-center/

The main idea of our website is helping people who love pets take care of their pets. For example, the two websites provide advice for caring pets. However, our website will not only target on giving advice but also target on pet service. Many times pet owners cannot travel or have insufficient time to take care of their pets.  Our user could use pet service to solve this problem. Pet service means a user can provide pet service to other users and get corresponding credit.  Next time, the service provider can use credit to make others help him to take care of his pet. 

Our website will use a form of a forum to help users get tips on taking care of pets. Users can write their own article about their pet tips. Users also can discuss their pet raising experience with others in the forum. Those activities on the forum can also get corresponding credit.

Data type: User information, Forum information and pet  service information. 

## Important Components: 

One component of MyPet website is creating a platform for users to post their questions and receive answers from others. MyPet website includes three main functions: user login and profile, forum page and pet service page. 

Users can create their own login name and password. There will be a credit number associated with each user. Each user would get 20 credits when they start. 

Users can post their questions relating to their pets and comment on other user’s questions. After a question is posted, it will show up on the forum page of the website. Users can also search for keywords in the forum page. For posting each question or comment, users will receive credits accordingly. Users may also see what others have asked and click “useful” if they think the answers help. 

Users can provide or receive pet services to other users. Users can search for the services they want on the service page with keywords. Users can also provide services to other users. This page will be information-based, users will post their location, type of service, service facility and what kind of pets they can receive. Users need to use credits to get service and will receive credits by providing services to others.
