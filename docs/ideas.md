## Innovative Idea:

Our website relates to an existing website “PetCoach”. https://www.petcoach.co/educational-center/

The main idea of our website is to help people who love pets take care of their pets. For example, the two websites provide advice for caring pets. However, our website will not only target giving advice but also target pet service. Many times pet owners cannot travel or have insufficient time to take care of their pets.  Our user could use pet service to solve this problem. Pet service means a user can provide pet service to other users and get corresponding credit.  Next time, the service provider can use credit to make others help him to take care of his pet. 

Our website will have some articles to help users get tips on taking care of pets. Users can write their own articles about their pet tips.  The user who writes articles to help others can also get corresponding credit.

Data type: User information, tip information, and pet service information. 

## Important Components: 

MyPet website is creating a platform for users to post their questions and receive answers from others. MyPet website includes three main functions: user login ,profile and pet service page. 

Users can provide or receive pet services to other users by using our pet service. Users can also provide services to other users. This page will be information-based, users will post their location, type of service, service facility and what kind of pets they can receive. Users need to use credits to get service and will receive credits by providing services to others. 

* Each user would get 20 credits when they start.  
* Each user can use username and password to login in our website.
* Each user will have profile to help each other in our website to "know" each other.
* Each users can post listings requesting service
* Each users can "apply" to provide service
* the service provider will gets credits
* the requester will give her credits to service provider
