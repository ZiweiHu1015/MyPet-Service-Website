Innovative Idea:
Our website relates to an existing website “PetCoach”. https://www.petcoach.co/educational-center/
The main idea of our website is helping people who love pets take care of their pets. For example, the two websites provide advice for caring pets. However, our website will not only target on giving advice but also target on pet service. Many times pet owners cannot travel or have insufficient time to take care of their pets.  Our user could use pet service to solve this problem. Pet service means a user can provide pet service to other users and get corresponding credit.  Next time, the service provider can use credit to make others help him to take care of his pet. 

Our website will use a form of a forum to help users get tips on taking care of pets. Users can write their own article about their pet tips. Users also can discuss their pet raising experience with others in the forum. Those activities on the forum can also get corresponding credit.

Data type: User information, Forum information and pet  service information.
